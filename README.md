# Image-Steganography-Tool
My project during my role as a Cybersecurity intern at Edunet Foundation 

It is a steganography tool meant for hiding messages in images for a secure communication between users and data protection. Some of its feautres are:
1. User-friendly text-based interface
2. Sophisticated encoding and decoding processes
3. Comprehensive error handling mechanism
4. Use of a cipher for further data security

The aim of this projhect is to deliver a robust and versatile tool thst meets the needs of individuals and organisations seeking secure methods for communication and data protection.
